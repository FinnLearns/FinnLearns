**Welcome to FinnLearns!** This site is dedicated to sharing the various projects I've created and the lessons I've learned in doing so. But before you start browsing, I'd like to introduce myself.

Ever since I finished geometry when I was 15 years old I've been enthtralled by math and science, both for their own sake and because of their novel applications to technology. I'm especially interested in circuit design (owing to my love of guitar pedals and digital photography), but my curiosity encompasses a broad range of subjects. Currently, I'm pursuing these interests by attending the University of Colorado Boulder to obtain an electrical engineering degree.

In addition to my coursework, I also play guitar and have performed across Kansas and Colorado with my brother as an acoustic duo. To check out our work you can visit our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ItsMurfMusic) which contains all of our music. Besides playing gigs for restaurants and private events we've performed multiple shows for retirement homes, fundraising events, a city-wide music festival in the Kansas City metro, and even a wedding!

Below are a few other personal achievements and fun-facts:

* Before transferring to Boulder I attended the Johnson County Community College (JCCC) in Kansas, where I earned a spot on the honor roll every semester for maintaining a 4.0 GPA.
* In the spring of 2024 I participated in JCCC's annual STEM research symposium, in which I earned an industry-sponsored scholarship for my research on using computational integration to simulate a rocket's dynamics. I again participated in the event in the spring of 2025 with a poster on the appliations of the fourier transform in signal processing, for which I also earned a scholarship.
* Running is one of my favorite hobbies, and despite the fact that I've never been injury free since I started I've managed to finish multiple 10k's, a half-marathon, and a full marathon. It's my personal goal to someday run an ultramarathon, and I've particularly set my sights on the Leadville 100.
* I've placed in a couple of guitar competitions over the years, winning first place for finger style guitar at the 2021 FidPick contests in Lawrence, KS, and second place for finger style at the 2021 Oklahoma State Fair contests. Recently I've broadened my musical horizons to include flatpicking on the guitar, and I hope to soon start entering competitions in that style of playing.
* I am a huge fan of "neo-traditional" country music, with my top three artists being the Turnpike Troubadors, Tyler Childers, and Sturgill Simpson, although there's many other musicians making amazing music in this genre. I also enjoy reading, especially about U.S history.
